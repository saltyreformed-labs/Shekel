"""``quill spec-history`` and ``quill spec-revert``: a card's body edits, for the review
R-BAL174 requires of a step's spec, and the restore of an earlier version by hand.  A card's spec
is its body in the tracker, and an edit to it counts the moment it is saved, so the review reads
every edit since the work started (``spec-history --since card/N``).

Split out of the command module, which the regroup's pass in ``quill sync`` (plan#4021) would
take past the 1,000 lines ``too-many-lines`` allows.
